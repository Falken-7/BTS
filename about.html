        <p>Banyan Tree School aims to empower students to be self reliant and equip them with the abilities to face the challenges of the world. We believe that children have the ability to construct their own knowledge if given a safe and secure environment to grow and flourish. The skills of critical thinking, problem solving, a spirit of inquiry and a questioning mind enables students to tread on a path of self discovery.</p>
